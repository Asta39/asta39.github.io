                <h2>How to Start in Kenya</h2>
                <p>Starting as an online article writer in Kenya is quite accessible. First, hone your writing skills â€“ practice by starting your own blog or contributing to forums. Create a portfolio of your best work; this could include samples you've written specifically for your portfolio.</p>
                <p>Sign up on international freelancing platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, or Freelancer.com.

                <p>Be prepared to start with lower rates as you build your reputation and portfolio. Consistency and quality work are key to getting repeat clients and better-paying projects.</p>
